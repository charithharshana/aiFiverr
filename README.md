## 🛠️ Installation & Quick Start Guide 🛠️

### 📦 Installation (Let's Get This Party Started!)

Alright, since this isn't (yet?) on the Chrome Web Store (because who has time for reviews? 🙄), you gotta load it manually like a true tech wizard (or someone who can follow instructions).

1.  **Grab the Goods 🛍️:** Download the extension files. Either clone the repository or download the ZIP and unzip it somewhere you won't accidentally delete it later. Let's call this magical place the `ai-rewriter-extension` folder.
2.  **Open Chrome's Secret Lair 🚪:** Open Google Chrome, type `chrome://extensions` in your address bar, and hit Enter. Spooooky!
3.  **Flip the Super Secret Developer Switch 🕵️‍♀️:** Look for a toggle labeled "Developer mode" (usually in the top right corner). Click it. If it's on, you're basically a hacker now. Congrats.
4.  **Shove the Folder at Chrome 욱:** Click the "Load unpacked" button that magically appeared. A file browser window will pop up.
5.  **Point and Shoot 👉:** Navigate to and select that `ai-rewriter-extension` folder (the one *containing* the `manifest.json` file, not the zip file!). Click "Select Folder" or "Open".
6.  **Bask in the Glory (or fix errors) 🙏:** If all went well, you should see the "AI Text Rewriter Pro" extension card appear on the page! If you see angry red errors, you probably messed up step 5. Go back and try again, champ. 💪
7.  **Pin for Easy Access:** Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome's toolbar and pin the AI Text Rewriter Pro extension for quick access.

🎉 **Ta-da!** The extension icon should appear in your Chrome toolbar!

### 🚀 Quick Start Guide

#### 1. Initial Setup
1. Click the extension icon or right-click → "Settings"
2. Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
3. Paste your API key and test the connection
4. Customize your settings (models, modes, shortcuts)
5. Save and start rewriting!

#### 2. Using the Extension
**Right-Click Method:**
1. Select text in any editable field
2. Right-click on the selected text
3. Choose "✨ Rewrite with AI" → pick your desired mode
4. Watch the magic happen!

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+H` - Humanize selected text
- `Ctrl+Shift+P` - Professional tone
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` - Undo last rewrite

## ⚙️ Configuration: The Golden Ticket 🔑

Okay, here's the *slightly* annoying part. This extension needs **YOUR** Google Gemini API Key to actually talk to the AI. Think of it like needing a password to get into the cool AI club.

**Why?** Because accessing powerful AI models costs money (or at least has usage limits), and Google needs to know who's asking! This extension makes requests directly from *your* browser using *your* key.

**Where to Snag This Magical Key? 🤔**

1.  Go to the **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**. You'll likely need a Google account.
2.  Click the button that says something like "Create API key".
3.  It might ask you to create a project first. Just follow the prompts, nod wisely, and click "Agree" to things you probably won't read.
4.  Eventually, it will reveal your **SECRET API KEY**. It's a long string of random letters and numbers.
5.  **COPY THIS KEY!** 📋 Treat it like a password. Don't share it publicly!

**Plugging in the Power Cord 🔌**

1.  Click the **AI Text Rewriter Pro extension icon** 🧩 in your Chrome toolbar. This should open the modern Options page.
    *   *Alternatively:* Go back to `chrome://extensions`, find the AI Text Rewriter Pro card, click "Details", then "Extension options". So many clicks!
2.  You'll see a field labeled "**Gemini API Key**". It's a password field, so you won't see the key as you paste (oooooh, security! ✨).
3.  **PASTE** your copied API key into this box.
4.  Click the glorious "**Save Key**" button. 💾
5.  You *should* see a happy green message saying "API Key saved successfully!". ✅ If you see an angry red message, well... Houston, we have a problem. 🚀 (Did you paste the *whole* key?).

**❗ IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT YOUR KEY ❗**

*   **Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe!** 🔒 Don't commit it to public code, don't paste it in random chat rooms. It's linked to *your* Google account.
*   **Usage Might Cost $$$!** Google often has a free tier for their APIs, but heavy usage *could* potentially incur costs. Check their pricing! You are responsible for the usage associated with your key. Don't blame us if you rewrite War and Peace and get a bill. 💸

---

## ✨ How to Use (The Fun Part!) ✨

Okay, installed? ✅ API key saved? ✅ Ready to rock? ✅ Let's rewrite!

1.  **Find a Victim... I Mean, a Text Box 🎯:** Go to any website with a text input field (`<textarea>`, some `<input>` fields). Think email drafts, comment boxes, social media posts, online notepads... you get the idea.
    *   **Heads Up:** This probably *won't* work on super fancy custom editors like Google Docs or Notion directly, as they do weird things. It *definitely* won't work on `chrome://` pages (like the extensions page itself) for security reasons! Stick to normal web pages (http/https).
2.  **Type Your Soon-to-be-Glorious Words ⌨️:** Write something. Anything! Pour your heart out, or just type "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".
3.  **Highlight the Chosen Ones ✨:** Select the text you want to transform using your mouse or keyboard.
4.  **Invoke the Menu! Right-Click Pow! 🖱️💥:** Right-click directly *on the selected text*.
5.  **Behold! The Menu! 🤩:** Hover over the "**✨ Rewrite with AI**" option in the context menu that pops up.
6.  **Pick Your Mode 🎭:** Choose one of the 17 available modes from the sub-menu (Humanize, Professional, Creative, Technical, etc.).
7.  **Patience, Grasshopper... 🌱:** A sleek notification will appear showing the progress. The extension sends your text and chosen mode to the selected Gemini AI model. Response time depends on text complexity and your selected AI model. 🐹
8.  **Witness the Transformation! 🪄:** If the AI gods smile upon you, the selected text will be **replaced** with the rewritten version! 🎉

## 🤔 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Sideways) 🤔

Yeah, sometimes technology just says "NOPE". 🙅‍♂️ Here's a comprehensive guide:

### Common Issues

**😭 It's Not Working AT ALL!**
*   **API Key:** Did you *actually* save your API key correctly in the options? Is it the *right* key? Double-check!
*   **Reload Extension:** Go to `chrome://extensions` and click the little refresh icon 🔄 on the AI Text Rewriter Pro card. Sometimes extensions get sleepy.
*   **Reload Page:** Try refreshing the webpage (F5) you're trying to use it on.
*   **Check Console (Background):** Go to `chrome://extensions`, find the AI Text Rewriter Pro card, and click the "**Service worker**" link. Look for **RED ERROR MESSAGES** in the console window that pops up *after* you try to use the extension. Copy/paste these if you need help!
*   **Check Console (Page):** On the webpage where it's failing, right-click anywhere, select "Inspect", and go to the "Console" tab. Try using the extension again. Any **RED ERRORS** there?

**"API Key not working"**
- Verify key is correctly copied from Google AI Studio
- Check if your Google account has API access enabled
- Test connection in Settings → General → Test API Key

**🚫 Error: `Cannot access chrome:// URL`**
*   You're trying to use the extension on a Chrome settings page (like `chrome://extensions`). For security reasons, Chrome blocks extensions from messing with these pages. Use it on a regular `http://` or `https://` website.

**"Cannot rewrite on this page"**
- Extension only works on regular websites (http/https)
- Won't work on Chrome internal pages (chrome://)
- Ensure you're in an editable text field

**"Text not replacing"**
- Click in the text field before selecting text
- Try refreshing the page and attempting again
- Check browser console for detailed error messages

**✨ Weird Output (Options, Asterisks `*`, Emails when you didn't ask?)**
*   The AI can be a bit... creative. We've tried to tell it *very sternly* in the prompts to JUST give the rewritten text and nothing else (no markdown like `*emphasis*`, no "Option 1:", etc.).
*   If you still get weird formatting or unexpected content (like a full email for "Professional Tone"), the AI might be ignoring instructions. We added some cleanup code, but it's not perfect. Prompt engineering is hard! 🤷‍♂️

**🚦 Error: `Content blocked by API...`**
*   The AI's safety filters might have flagged your original text or the requested rewrite (especially possible with "Cheeky"). Try rephrasing your original text or using a different mode.

**"Too many requests"**
- Built-in rate limiting prevents API overuse
- Wait 60 seconds and try again
- Consider upgrading your Google AI Studio plan for higher limits

**📉 API Errors (4xx/5xx Status)**
*   `400 Bad Request`: Often means the model name is wrong or the request format is broken. Try switching AI models in settings.
*   `401 Unauthorized` / `403 Forbidden`: Almost always an **API Key problem**. Is it correct? Is it enabled? Does your Google Cloud project have the API enabled?
*   `404 Not Found`: The API endpoint URL might be wrong.
*   `429 Too Many Requests`: You might be hitting rate limits on the free tier. Slow down!
*   `500 Internal Server Error`: Google's servers are having a hiccup. Try again later. ☕

### Getting Help
1. Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
2. Test your API connection in the settings
3. Try different AI models if one isn't working
4. Report issues with specific error messages

## 💡 Contributing (Got Ideas? Found Bugs?) 💡🐛

Hey, if you have ideas to make this less buggy or more awesome, or if you found a hilarious bug (like it rewriting everything into pirate speak 🏴‍☠️ - which would be kinda cool, actually), feel free to:

*   Open an issue on the GitHub repository (if this *is* on GitHub... otherwise, uh... tell the developer?).
*   Fork it, fix it, and submit a pull request (again, GitHub stuff).

We appreciate the help making this thing slightly less likely to explode. 🔥
