# aiFiverr Extension Test Directory

This directory contains test files and reference materials for the aiFiverr Chrome extension.

## Directory Structure

### `/verification-test.js` and `/verification-test.html`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive verification tests for the extension fixes
- **Usage**: Run these tests to verify that all fixes are working correctly
- **Features**: Tests file attachment, authentication persistence, API request construction, and more
- **Status**: âœ… Active - Used for testing the current extension functionality

### `/GeminiWithFiles-master/`
- **Purpose**: Reference implementation of Google Apps Script library for Gemini API with files
- **Usage**: Reference material for understanding Gemini API integration patterns
- **Status**: ðŸ“š Reference - Contains example code and documentation for Gemini API usage
- **Note**: This is a third-party library used as reference material

### `/auth/`
- **Purpose**: Reference materials for Google Apps Script authentication patterns
- **Usage**: Contains example code for user authentication in Google Apps Script web apps
- **Status**: ðŸ“š Reference - Used as reference for authentication implementation patterns
- **Note**: Contains Google Apps Script examples, not directly used by the Chrome extension

## Running Tests

### Verification Tests
1. Open the Chrome extension
2. Navigate to a Fiverr page
3. Open the browser console
4. Load the verification test:
   ```javascript
   // The test will run automatically when the extension is loaded
   // Or manually run:
   const test = new VerificationTest();
   test.runAllTests();
   ```

### Test Coverage
The verification tests cover:
- âœ… Manager availability (all required managers loaded)
- âœ… File type support (all required MIME types supported)
- âœ… Authentication persistence (Google OAuth token handling)
- âœ… Knowledge base file resolution (files properly resolved with geminiUri)
- âœ… Text selection flow (prompt processing with files)
- âœ… API request construction (proper fileData parts in requests)

## Test Results Interpretation

### Expected Results
- **Manager Availability**: All required managers should be available
- **File Type Support**: All specified file types should be supported
- **Authentication Persistence**: Tokens should persist across sessions
- **Knowledge Base File Resolution**: Files should resolve with valid geminiUri values
- **Text Selection Flow**: Prompts should process with attached files
- **API Request Construction**: Requests should include fileData parts for attached files

### Troubleshooting
If tests fail:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify extension is properly loaded on a Fiverr page
3. Ensure Google authentication is completed
4. Check that knowledge base files are uploaded and have valid geminiUri values

## Cleanup Status
- âœ… Test files are organized and documented
- âœ… Reference materials are preserved for future development
- âœ… Active test files are clearly identified
- âœ… Project structure is clean and maintainable

## Notes
- The test directory contains both active test files and reference materials
- Reference materials are kept for development purposes and future enhancements
- All test files are properly documented and organized
- No temporary or unnecessary files were found that needed cleanup
