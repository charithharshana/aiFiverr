## 🔍 **RATE LIMITING INVESTIGATION RESULTS**

### **✅ MYSTERY SOLVED**

The 429 rate limiting errors were caused by **recursive retry logic**, not by the number of tests:

#### **Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Large File Issue**: 31KB portfolio file causes MAX_TOKENS limit (12,098 prompt tokens)
2. **Infinite Recursion**: Original retry logic had no limits, creating cascading API calls
3. **Streaming Fallback**: Failed streaming attempts added extra API calls
4. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Multiple retries quickly exceeded 10 calls/minute limit

#### **API Call Pattern (Before Fix):**
```
1. File Upload → Success
2. Streaming Attempt → Fails → Calls generateContent
3. generateContent → MAX_TOKENS → Retry #1
4. Retry #1 → MAX_TOKENS → Retry #2
5. Retry #2 → MAX_TOKENS → Retry #3
... (continues until rate limit hit)
```

#### **API Call Pattern (After Fix):**
```
1. File Upload → Success
2. Streaming Attempt → Fails → Calls generateContent
3. generateContent → MAX_TOKENS → Retry #1 (without file)
4. Retry #1 → MAX_TOKENS → Retry #2 (without file)
5. Retry #2 → MAX_TOKENS → Fallback Response
6. File Cleanup → Success
Total: 6 controlled API calls
```
